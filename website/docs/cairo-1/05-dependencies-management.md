# Dependencies

Protostar uses [Scarb](https://github.com/software-mansion/scarb) to manage dependencies in your project.
In order to use Protostar with Cairo 1 you must have Scarb executable added to the `PATH` environment variable. 
The `PATH` variable is a list of directories that your system searches for executables.
