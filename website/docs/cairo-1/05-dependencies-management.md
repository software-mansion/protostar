# Managing dependencies

Protostar uses [Scarb](https://github.com/software-mansion/scarb) and its [manifest files](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs/reference/manifest) to manage dependencies in your project.
In order to use Protostar with Cairo 1 you must have Scarb executable added to the `PATH` environment variable. 
The `PATH` variable is a list of directories that your system searches for executables.

To learn how to manage dependencies with Scarb check [the documentation](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs/reference/specifying-dependencies).
