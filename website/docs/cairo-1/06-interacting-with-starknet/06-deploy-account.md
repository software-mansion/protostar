# Creating an account

## Overview

In order to create a new account, you need to deploy an account contract. Starknet expects a certain interface from an
account
contract. [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/blob/main/src/openzeppelin/account/presets/Account.cairo)
and [ArgentX](https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-contracts-starknet/blob/develop/contracts/account/ArgentAccount.cairo)
provide account contract implementations that you can use.

There are three ways of deploying a new account contract:

- sending [`DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` transaction](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/releases/tag/v0.10.1)
- using already deployed account contract and deploying new one
  via [the Universal Deployer Contract](https://community.starknet.io/t/universal-deployer-contract-proposal/1864)
- (deprecated)
  sending [`DEPLOY` transaction](https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/develop/Blocks/transactions/#deploy_transaction)

## Sending `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` transaction

Protostar allows you to send the `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` transaction from the CLI by calling
the [`deploy-account` command](/docs/cli-reference#deploy-account).
However, before you send such transaction you need to:

1. Find the class hash of the account contract compatible with `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` transaction. The entity that declared
   the account contract should make the class hash easily available. It's recommended to check the README.md in the
   repository with the source of the account contract:
    - [OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts)
    - [argentlabs/argent-contracts-starknet](https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-contracts-starknet)
2. Calculate an account contract address
   with [`protostar calculate-account-address` command](/docs/cli-reference#calculate-account-address)
3. Prefund the account contract.
