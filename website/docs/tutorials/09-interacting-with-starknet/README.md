## Interacting with StarkNet

We provide a couple of commands which allow any user to interact with starknet without the need to install [`cairo-lang`](https://pypi.org/project/cairo-lang/) Python package locally.


We currently support:
 
```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
