# Interacting With Starknet

Protostar provides a couple of commands allowing users to interact with Starknet.

Protostar offers similar CLI to Starknet's CLI. However, with Protostar you can move deployment configuration to
protostar.toml and display help for each command.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
